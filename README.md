# Sharpe_Ratio_Project
**Creating a reward-to-variability ratio to compare expected returns on similar investments and calculate additional return per unit of risk by choosing one over the other**.

## Project Description and Background Information
How can we compare different investments that on average may deliver similar results but exhibit different levels of risk?

Professor William Sharpe introduced the *reward-to-variability ratio* also known as the **Sharpe Ratio** 

The **Sharpe Ratio** compares the expected returns for two investment opportunities and calculates the additional return per unit of risk an investor could obtain by choosing one over the other.

In mathematical terms, it looks at the difference in returns for two investments and compares the average difference to the standard deviation (as a measure of risk) of this difference.

A higher the ratio means that the reward will be higher for a given amount of risk.

### Original Use and how I will be using it for this case study 
The Sharpe ratio is usually calculated for a portfolio and uses the risk-free interest rate as benchmark.

However, for this case study I will use stocks instead of a portfolio. I will also use a stock index as benchmark rather than the risk-free interest rate because both are readily available at daily frequencies and I do not have to worry about converting interest rates from annual to daily frequency.
